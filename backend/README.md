# How to use the docker image

Navigate to the ```/backend``` directory,
then run the following command:

```bash
docker build --tag genetic-algorithms .
```

To run the docker image use:

```bash
docker run genetic-algorithms
```

On Linux/Unix systems docker commands require root privileges by default.
