Evolution: The driving force for diversity and adaptation on our planet. Natural selection ensures that only the strongest survive and pass on the secret of their success to their children.
Our simulation uses these same principles in the form of genetic algorithms to find the optimal balance between performance and consumption in vehicles.
For each configuration of parameters, the programme returns the Pareto front, a collection of solutions where no value can be improved without worsening another.
